# Team Charter

## Vision
To improve current understanding of the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and to predict likelihood and extent of benefit from undergoing prone mechanical ventilation treatment strategy in patients with ARDS to improve their clinical outcome and, ultimately, their survival.

## Mission
A novel patient-specific biophysical computational model is being developed and will be validated for fulfilling the aims of this Ph.D. project outlined in the above-mentioned “vision”.

## Success criteria
Results derived from modelling simulations of ventilation, perfusion and gas exchange are being and will be compared with those obtained from retrospective and prospective clinical imaging data from collaborators for ensuring appropriateness and correctness of the computational model being developed:
-	Firstly, on relatively simple, conceptualised geometries simulating blocks of healthy and pathological lung tissue;
-	Secondly, upon retrospective clinical data pertaining to healthy subjects;
-	Eventually, upon retrospective and prospective clinical data on patients with ARDS.

Several performance measures, such as sensitivity and specificity (e.g., via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves) will be adopted to quantify the accuracy and reliability of modelling predictions.

## Team agreement
To ensure constructive communication and fruitful collaboration amongst internal collaborators (from the Auckland Bioengineering Institute, ABI, the University of Auckland), the following ‘tools’ are adopted:
-	Fortnightly supervisory meeting;
-	Meetings with supervisors as required;
-	Asana for sharing findings and research questions with supervisors and within the Lungs and Respiratory System Research Group. 

Furthermore, the following ‘tools’ are adopted with external collaborators:
-	Monthly group meeting on Skype;
-	Dropbox for sharing anonymised patient raw data, metadata and findings for quality assurance and comparison purposes.

## Project team
Roles and responsibilities have been clearly outlined in the research grants which this project fits in.
