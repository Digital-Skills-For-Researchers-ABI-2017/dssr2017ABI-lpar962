# Synopsis

This Ph.D. project involves the development and validation of a novel patient-specific biophysical, computational model to:
- gain a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 
- predict which patients prone mechanical ventilation can be more beneficial for.
