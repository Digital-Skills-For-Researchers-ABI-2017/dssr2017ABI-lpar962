# Synopsis

This Ph.D. project involves the development and validation of a novel patient-specific biophysical, computational model to gain a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and predict which patients prone mechanical ventilation can be more beneficial for. The aim of this project is to improve clinical outcome of patients with ARDS and, ultimately, their survival.
